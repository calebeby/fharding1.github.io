  <p>Hi. I'm Franklin Harding. I'm a Junior at Cleveland High School in Portland, OR., currently interning at Billups as an
    Engineering Intern and learning ServiceNow Development from The SN Guys. I love programming, mostly focusing on web development
    with Go and React, but I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty with some C or assembly. My hobbies besides programming and
    general computer nerd stuff includes robotics (Pigmice FRC 2733), skiing, building mechanical keyboards, hiking, and
    collecting vinyl records. I listen to a plethora of music: EDM, Synthpop, Classic Rock, Hip Hop, whatever I think sounds
    cool.
